# Portfolio Website
Source code for my personal website. I am currently using the following
- Typescript
- Tailwindcss

The purpose of open sourcing the website is to allow visitors of my website to view the source code and show what I can do. I plan on open sourcing the projects I do overtime. At this point I currently have a few Java projects to open source.
