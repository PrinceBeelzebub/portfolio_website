# Portfolio Website
Source code for my personal website. I am currently using the following
- JavaScript (Typescript, Node.js)
- CSS (Sass)
- HTML

The purpose of open-sourcing the website is to allow visitors of my website to view the source code and show some of what I can do. I plan on open-sourcing the projects I do overtime. At this point, I currently have a few Java projects source code to release.
